An exercise in design, this website was created as a fully-responsive landing page linking to my various professional profiles. 

I used a combination of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, and deployed my serverless website using Netlify. 

Before writing any code, I created various mockups what I wanted my website to look like on various screen resolutions using Figma. This gave me the flexibility to easily change my design. 

In order to make the website responsive, I used a combination of CSS flexbox and media queries.

In order to create the typewriter annimation, I followed this [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POX3dT-pB4E&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) tutorial.
